Our dataset contain 430 patients and 1197 blood metabolites for each patient
and our goal is to find key biological metabolites that could explain part of the
variability in diabetes.  We followed this process:

* Cluster Analysis: We want to see how many clusters can be created for our
data. Moreover, we need to know which of the metabolites belong to each
cluster, i.e how the clustering was made.

* Classification/Regression analysis: We created some models to find the
important features (blood metabolites) that were used in order to classify
if a person has diabetes or not.

In the end, we found that the most important features are CC_48153 and CC_48152.
Also other blood metabolites have an important role.
